NEED TO CLEAN UP CODE IN STATSBOMB-360-PLAYGROUND REPO AND MAKE AVAILABLE IN GET GOALSIDE PUBIC CODE REPO

## Tech/Skills

- StatsBomb360 data
- Data science

## Summary

StatsBomb360 data is an 'event+' dataset: event data that also supplies a freezeframe of broadcast footage-based location data for each event. The freezeframes contain team and goalkeeper/outfield information, but no further player information. In the project, I worked to label the players with probable player positions (e.g. right-back), based on formation information plus the unlabelled freezeframes.

## Learnings

**Something about maths and algorithms**

**Imbalances of broadcast tracking data**

## Deeper dive
