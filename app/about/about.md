I'm Mark. I make stuff, make sense of stuff, or make sense of it for others.

At varying points in time, the focus of that has been:

- History (university)
- The current world (journalism)
- Football data (as a blogger, researcher, industry newsletterer)
- Software development

I primarily work in Python, but take an interest in things beyond that - the [Projects](/projects) page gives a sense of where my curiousities lie. Day-to-day I also have experience of API development and data engineering that doesn't fit into, or can't be shared as, a discrete 'project'.

### Football

I have extensive experience with football data, and with using it for data science projects and various types of software products. That experience lies across statistics, event data, and tracking data.

It's little wonder, then, that I also occasionally write a newsletter about football data and analytics, called [Get Goalside](https://www.getgoalsideanalytics.com/). It's read by a lot of smart people.

The number of data providers whose data I've worked with in some capacity currently stands at **10**. (In alphabetical order, they are: Impect, Metrica Sports, Opta, Ortec, Second Spectrum, Skillcorner, Sportlogiq, StatsBomb, Strategem, Wyscout).
