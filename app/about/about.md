I'm Mark. I make stuff, make sense of stuff, or make sense of it for others.

At varying points in time, the focus of that has been:

- the study of history (university)
- the study of the current world (journalism)
- football data (as a blogger, researcher, and industry nuisance)
- software development

I primarily work in Python, but take an interest in things beyond that. The [Projects](/projects) page gives a sense of where my curiousities lie, while day-to-day I also have experience of API development and data engineering that haven't yet been part of a shiny hobby task.

### Football

I have extensive experience with football data, and with using it for data science projects and various types of software products.

It's little wonder, then, that I also occasionally write a newsletter about football data and analytics, called [Get Goalside](https://www.getgoalsideanalytics.com/). It's read by a lot of smart people, several of whom even think it's good.

The list of companies whose data I've worked with, in some capacity, currently stands at **10**. In alphabetical order, they are: Impect, Metrica Sports, Opta, Ortec, Second Spectrum, Skillcorner, Sportlogiq, StatsBomb, Strategem, Wyscout.
