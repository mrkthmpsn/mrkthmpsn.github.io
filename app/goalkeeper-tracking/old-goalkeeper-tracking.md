### Introduction

It’s a joke in football analytics that, when looking at a new attacking metric, you sort the players top to bottom and look for Lionel Messi. Similarly, if you create a metric about goalkeepers holding onto the ball under pressure (and call it ‘heart attack’), you do the same and look for Manuel Neuer.

This project – diving into a [publicly-available trove of Skillcorner broadcast tracking data]('https://github.com/SkillCorner/opendata') – didn’t start with goalkeepers though. It started with a quote from Xavi about long balls, hit some educational roadbumps, and ended with the German stopper.

Along the way, we:

- Process some raw tracking data
- Encounter and deal with some problems with (broadcast) tracking data
- Refine project ideas
- Create new metrics

### History

Work trying to generate event data from tracking data has a relatively long history
