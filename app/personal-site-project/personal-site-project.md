## Summary

I made this site...

I set up a version of a personal site when first dipping my toe into front-end development in summer 2023, hosting it using Github pages (which it still is). I redesigned the landing page and project pages to make it look better, be better to navigate, and better reflect my skills.

## Learnings

**Web design isn't easy**

This was my first project dealing with a website-like system which (should) work nicely across different device sizes. Using Tailwind CSS helped quite a lot, feeling more intuitive for me to use from my starting point. This was a steep learning curve technically and in terms of what looks good on the screen compared to in scribbled sketches.

## Deep dive

The pitch animation on the landing page is a transplant from the ['build-up debug' app project](/debug-buildup). The colour scheme comes partly from [coolors.co](coolors.co) and partly from [UI colors](https://uicolors.app/create).

The highlighter text effect behind my name may well be something that actual web developers would recognise instantly, but was something that basically came from ChatGPT collaboration.

I think that, while the site is quite clearly a case of 'not a web developer trying their hand at web development', it's a significant upgrade of what was created just 11 months ago.
